# NextWorkout
NextWorkout is a full-stack workout tracking app (designed to be used as progressive web app on your phone). It uses a React-based SPA frontend and a Fastify-based backend API, connected to a Supabase PostgreSQL database for data persistence and authentication. You can access it at [nextworkout.fly.dev](https://nextworkout.fly.dev), and read more about the setup in `architecture.md`.

## Background
I have chronic pain that's best managed by consistently doing a decently wide range of exercises and stretches. However, my schedule is busy and my body isn't always feeling up for certain exercises, so it's hard for me to have a recurring workout schedule. 

I used to sometimes forget about certain exercises for a while and then my pain would flare up again, so I built NextWorkout to give me a view that no other workout tracking app did: within a given group (back, knee, stretches), *which exercises have the **longest gap** since I last performed them?*
